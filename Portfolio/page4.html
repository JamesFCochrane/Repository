    This image is from the series, "Future Vision", in which I used text-to-image AI software to generate images of the potential futures of the United States based on our adequate or inadequate response
    to the climate crisis. I asked Chat GPT what the United States would look like in 200 years if we ignored the climate crisis as well as the opposite. I used the given answers to generate images
    that reflect the ideas presented by Chat GPT. The final images are presented in New Art City and are accompanied by audio that fully expresses the answers given by Chat GPT.
