            My inspiration behind this piece came when I heard a psychologist on Youtube talk about depressed people's
            perspectives on life.
            He claimed that depressed people tend to take daily experiences<br> and apply them to their life in general.
            For example, "My day sucked so
            my life sucks." It made me think of how I do exactly that.
            From there I started to think about all the adjectives you could use to describe life.<br> Due to all the
            various experiences we have in life, you could generalize
            life in any way you want and be right to some degree. So, I tried to attach these adjectives to a human
            lifespan in some way.<br> I ended up with 63 adjectives,
            which is meant to be 1 adjective for each sentient year of the average human life. The average human in the
            world lives to about 73.<br> I subtracted 10 as you're practically
            not conscious until you're at least ten, which is likely very generous. Once you get through your 63 years,
            you die, which is your reward for enduring so much.
