            As a digital artist, I work across various media including but not limited to digital illustration, virtual
            3D installation,
            and digital film. In my latest work, I have crafted a 3D virtual reality experience that depicts my personal
            struggle with anxiety, marijuana abuse, and how it affects my worldview. I have done so using imagery of fun
            and colorful yet possibly fear-inducing clowns and theme park attractions, with an offering and potential
            use of marijuana mixed in. The scene itself takes place in a liminal space made up of unending white sprawl
            and colored tiles that suggest some sort of false comfort. The work centers around ideas of anxiety,
            existentialism,
            substance abuse, and feelings of uncertainty and aimlessness. While making it, I had to make sense of why I
            found this imagery to be compelling and in some way accurate. Through the piece, I have been able to explore
            my relationship with anxiety and its contribution to my unwarranted cautiously negative perceptions of the
            world.

                of video games and is an advocate for games as an art form. He is interested in exploring interactive
                digital art as a medium, seeking to intertwine the conceptual freedom of visual art with the
                interactivity
                of video games. James Currently works and lives in San Jose, California, and is seeking his next step.
