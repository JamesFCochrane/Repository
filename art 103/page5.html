    <h1>Assignment 8: Reading #3 Artifacts and Material Speculation
    </h1><br><br>

    <h2>Q1. From the podcast, how has our understanding of what dinoasaurs 
        really look like evolved? Describe the progression of how we portrayed 
        them and how might this effect our understanding of what Archeology is 
        saying about them.</h2>

        <p>
            Our understanding of how dinosaurs may look has evolved from viewing them as 
            slow and unintelligent beasts, to seeing them as fast, cunning, and muscular 
            machines. We then began to consider ways in which they may store fat, which we 
            aren't truly aware of due to loss of fat in fossilization. This has made 
            clear to me that we don't actually know what dinosaurs looked like (or sounded like!) 
            and we are all just speculating on it based on skeletal structure. 
            Perhaps we've nailed it, perhaps not. It's fun to imagine the possibilies, and 
            maybe deeper understanding will come from it. 
        </p>

    <h2>Q2. The artist/archcologist John Conway who is doing interpretaions of dinosaurs 
        is obviously taking liberty with what could be the actual truth of how these creatures 
        existed. What other fields of science, creative based disciplines and forms of studies 
        use similer techniques that reminds you of this method or process. Please elaborate with 
        your examples both written as well as images and links.</h2>

        <p>
            One thing I was reminded of was how our perceptions of Jesus from the Bible 
            are shaped pretty much entirely by imagery made by painters of the past. 
            When I imagine god, I often picture something like god in the Sistene Chapel, 
            reaching out to Adam. Which is completely ridiculous. There is an image of what Jesus 
            most likely actually looked like, which surely more accurate, but still an 
            estimation, ultimately. Either way, the "realistic" depiction is now how I imagine 
            jesus in my head.

    <h2>Q3. First, summerize in your own words the definition of 'Material Speculation' 
        as described in the second and fourth article. Then, given the examples in the 
        second article as well as the other examples provided of possible future products, 
        how can 'Material Speculation' also be used to create speculative objects that refer 
        to the past? What might be an example of a fictional object from the past, that 
        creates the same dynamic of speculation.</h2>

        <p>
            Material speculation is coming up with objects that would exist in a what-if scenarios of any kind. The objects should 
            in some way reflect in its design the realities of that scenario or world that you are speculating on. Material speculation can 
            be used to imagine what objects may look like if factors of their surroundings or function changed. What would our modern machines look like if we never progressed past 
            steam engines? The possibilities are endless.
