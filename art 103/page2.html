    <h1>Assignment 5: Reading #2 Site Specific work</h1><br><br>
    <h2>Q1: What are the differences between Site Specific art work and the idea of Art Interventions?</h2>
    <p>
        Site specific artworks are works of art that are made with a specific location in mind. They are situated at that location and wouldn't make much 
        sense anywhere else. Art interventions are basically the act of shining a light on something in an artistic fashion. Like if you were to make an artwork out 
        of In-n-out's secret menu.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Q2: Choose 2 of the 4 artists shared and Answer the following for each artist.</h2>
    <h3>
        Banksy's "Dismaland"
    </h3>
<h4>
    A: Take one or more of the art works from the listed artists and please describe how a piece(s) function as site specific work or an intervention. 
    Please provide context and examples to explain your answer.
</h4>
<p>
Banksy's "Dismaland" functions as an art intervention. There is nothing about its physical location that is directly related to the artwork. It's in 
England, but the artwork doesn't reference the plot of land that it's situated on as it is more so based on modern society and perhaps how Disneyland embodies 
its ugly capitalist traits. It could be moved to california and make just as much, if not more sense. I suspect England may have been chosen for its consistent overcast weather 
and concrete.
<h4>
B: For the same piece(s), explain your interpretation of the work. What does it mean to you?
</h4>
<p>
I think the piece is commenting on some of the negative traits of modern first-world society. I think it's referencing consumerism, greed, and how 
Disneyland exudes both. Dismaland is a grungy place where you can ride some rides and look at things and buy things. Disneyland is the same on paper, though more expensive 
to the consumer and visually opulent. I went to Disneyland in 5th grade. It was cool but was essentially just 6 Flags with a Star Wars ride to me. I also got horribly sick. 
As an adult, I see Disneyland as an extremely expensive theme park and not much else. You buy the ticket, and from there you are free to wait in line for rides, 
ride rides, see the people in costumes and buy as much stuff as you want. Buy a somewhat decent lightsaber for only $250! None of that goes to the people who 
are paid minimum wage to constantly smile and dance around for your enjoyment. I still love Bambi, though. I think Banksy was trying to highlight how lame so much 
of reality is when you look deeper into what's going on in it. The orca jumping from a toilet to a kiddie pool is a good example of this messaging. Sea world seems fun 
if you see it as a place where you can see happy whales jump and do tricks. The reality is, though, that you would be happily paying for and supporting the torture of 
intelligent sea animals. <br><br>

<h3>
Hayat Nazer's "Lady Liberty of Lebanon"
</h3>
<h4>
    A: Take one or more of the art works from the listed artists and please describe how a piece(s) function as site specific work or an intervention. 
    Please provide context and examples to explain your answer.
</h4>
<p>
Nazer's piece is site-specific in that it is situated near Port of Beirut where a massive explosion took place in 2020. 
The artwork is made from debris collected from the explosion and is a memorial to those who perished in the tragedy. 
The artwork references people, materials, and experiences that are specific to the site it exists at and only there. 
</p>
<h4>
    B: For the same piece(s), explain your interpretation of the work. What does it mean to you?
    </h4>
    <p>
To me, the piece reads as an expression of mourning as well as unity and strength. It is a stark and strong woman 
which is made up of debris from the explosion and sentimental objects from locals. It represents people enduring pain and disaster 
and still standing stall. It is clear and powerful. People gave some of their most cherished possessions to be incorporated into the sculpture. 
I presume it was done as an act of respect, that people's most sentimentally important items might be a representation of the deep 
feelings experienced and what was lost to the disaster. <br><br>

    <h2>
        Q3: What is the single most important that all signs must share to be relevant and effective? 
        This means ALL signs, from art signs to traffic signs, to signs even in our home. 
        This is NOT about aesthetics or constuction, but just functionality of the idea.
    </h2>
<p>
    Though it would kinda give the main answer away, I can't think of another way to reword the question. 
    "Why is site specificity important for a sign?"<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Q4: What Kind of art, (not shown here), 
    have you seen that was made in response to its location, its environment, a specific event or situation. 
    Please elaborate on its description and provide 1 image for reference.

    In 8th grade, I was lucky enough to get to see New York and D.C. I saw the 9/11 Memorial. 
    There were two square waterfalls and the names of all who died were engraved around the edges of each. 
    Both are placed where the twin towers once stood as I understand. They were striking in person. So many names, 
    and the waterfalls were quite large.
