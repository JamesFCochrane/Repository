            This assignment was helpful in that it definitely helped me to 
            get more comfortable with Fusion. It was challenging, though. 
            There was a lot of wrestling with sketches to get the project function 
            to work as I wanted it to. It was also tough to get the loft to work 
            at some points. It was fun to design my own teapot, though. I was planning 
            for it to have 4 spouts and handles but that's just too much work. Instead, 
            this teapot is very likely to pour scalding water on your hand!
