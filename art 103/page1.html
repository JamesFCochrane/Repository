        For phase 1, we simply used the colors of paper we had to make the petrastars and the snake.
        We tried fitting the pieces for the petrastar together in different ways and made some interesting formations.<br><br>
        For the triangle tesselations, we made one set (left) with one common side and 2 sides of our own design. Each of us made 3 pieces of
        these, then we put them together. The tesselation on the right is made up of 6 of my own pieces.<br><br>
        I wanted to see how a tesselation would look if I made the sides as unusual as possible. <br><br><br><br>

For the hand cut fastener tests, my group and I all chose different materials to work with. I chose paper and cut out the red shapes.<br><br>
They linked together like a chain and were able to move quite a bit before coming apart. Its flexibility is an interesting feature but it must be held somewhat
taught for it not to fall apart.<br><br> The source I got it from said it can form a tetrahedron of some sort but I wasn't able to figure it out. 
Cat Le made a box with her cardboard slot joint fasteners, <br><br>Catherine Luong made paper hooks that formed a ring, and Norman made a box of paper using a folding/slotting technique.

        For these cuts, we made pieces in wood and paper. It was our first time using the laser cutter.
        My wooden designs are the ones that look kinda like cursive signatures.<br><br>
        I wanted to see how more detailed cuts would turn out. There were some very thin parts, 
        which I really should have taken more caution to avoid moving forward. (I didn't.)<br><br>
        As a group, we all used a common design on 2 sides of each piece that allowed us to fit them together.
        For our second wood cuts, we cut connecting key pieces from 2 squares of wood.<br><br> 
        This is the format we'd use for our final design. We also made some paper cuts, which are the black pieces of paper. 
        Mine are the circles with the 4 equally distanced cuts. <br><br>I made them just to see if anything interesting would happen if 
        I linked them together in different ways. They were somewhat interesting but did not lock together well.<br><br>

    As a group, we approached this assignment with the aim of recreating checkers with a Halloween theme. We wanted to use key fasteners
    that would connect 2 halfs to make a single board piece while <br><br>also serving as the support for player pieces. The board can 
    be assembled in any pattern desired, though edge pieces and corner pieces do face some restriction as far as placement on the board.<br><br>
    We did whatever we wanted as far as shapes for the keys, and something Halloweenish for our player pieces. We modified the way the game was played 
    in a few ways.<br><br> We added pieces that don't allow for movement which can be placed by the player, which are the clear pieces. We also modified
    the rules of the game so that you may move <br><br>forwards or backwards at any time and that kinged player pieces are able to move up, down, left, and right,  
    as opposed to just diagonally. For my own pieces, I made the board pieces (the excessively pointy ones)<br><br>
    seemingly as another test to see how far the laser cutter can go. My player pieces were based on things I found cool or funny
    while also somewhat related to Halloween. I made the alien, minion, and grim reaper.<br><br> Things that were successful about the 
    project were the mechanics of the game, the assemblage of the board, and the overall aesthetic. It was fun to play, looked good, 
    and could be assembled in the way we had hoped.<br><br> I was also very impressed with my group, the rainbows, who pulled hard throughout 
    and worked some long and stressful hours to put the poject together at all costs. Real troupers. We had some set backs. <br><br>Our first pass 
    was made of wood and was 2 layers. After gluing them, we found that the pieces wouldn't be able to fit together on a larger scale.
    Accounting for the cutting time and painting time that was now delayed, <br><br> we decided to move to acrylic instead of wood. We learned that
    acrylic has a real limit to the amout of detail you can include in your key pieces. Many of mine turned out pretty burnt and some of my board pieces were 
    prone to breakage.<br><br> Also, some of the inner slots in the key pieces were unusable due to melting. If I were to do it over, 
    I think some simplification of my key shapes and thickening of lines inside key slots/a new design for player pieces to connect to would be good.<br><br>
