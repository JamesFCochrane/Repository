    <h3>Part 2: Story, Model, and Documentation</h3>

    <h4>Story</h4>

    <p>
        The story behind my artifact is that in WWII, Soviet Russia developed jetpacks with cannons for 
        pigeons to wear into battle. The pigeons were trained using television programming and seed. They fought 
        valiantly to defend the motherland, and were ultimately effective in their role. The jetpacks gave them 
        great speed and a deadly armament. They were deployed in great numbers All of this has become 
        known to me due to this guy named Joe, who is my dad's buddy's sister's brother-in-law. It does sound 
        ridiculous, but he was very passionate about it, and there are other examples of animals being equipped with 
        human technologies of war. Russian anti-tank dogs, bats strapped with fire bombs and stuffed into clusterbombs. 
        Pigeons were tested for use in guiding bombs, and dophins have served the U.S. in a less combat oriented capacity 
        since the Vietnam war!
