My first location was Walmart. I chose it because here, at this exact area at the front far right corner, lives a mysterious and 
ghastly stench. I haven't smelled it in a while, but every time I walked past here each week a couple months ago, there was a horrid smell. 
At first, I would look around to see what is generating such an awful smell. But there was never anything of note to see. It is very strange and mysterious. 
I suspect many people have had a similar experience and feel the same way I do.

    <p>
Here at 27 North Apartments, the elevators are a source of anxiety. They make scary noises that suggest something going on with the cables running the elevators. 
The 2 pictured here were broken for about 2 months. There was only one other elevator, which broke for a day at one point, requiring me to traverse 7 stories of 
stairs and severely worrying me about the coming month of torturous cardio. But luckily, it was swiftly fixed, and we were all fortunate enough to have 1 elevator to wait for 
and cram into. Apparently this sort of thing happens regualarly. All of us 27 North residents got to experience this occurence and likely will again in the future.

    <p>
At Caliva, and any other dispensary, you are forbidden from consuming cannabis on the property. I have no issue with this, and I abide. There have been a few 
instances where I've noticed that the front door guard is almost certainly not following this rule. My roommate has noticed the same thing, and you wouldn't have to be 
a frequent shopper at Caliva or any other dispensary to make the same assessment. I found it funny that the guy who would potentially have to remove me from the property for 
consuming cannabis would have been consuming cannabis on the property.

    <h2>Artist Statement</h2><br><br>
    <p>
        My sign and stamp are based on San Jose's current city hall as well as the city hall it replaced. While researching San 
        Jose's current city hall, I started to read about the history of all the city halls that came before it. I learned that 
        the city hall that preceded our current one has a particularly ugly history. It was built upon the site of what was once a 
        massive Chinese market that was mysteriously burnt down during a period of particularly heightened anti-Chinese sentiment in the area. 
        The city did the only thing it could about the travesty. It built an exceptionally ugly city hall on the site while going as far as to 
        prohibit Chinese workers from contributing to the project. Upon learning this, I had a newfound respect for the new city hall. 
        It is far less spiritually ugly and looks better, too. It was very expensive, though. About $400 million when it was built, which is 
        about $500 million now! By contrast, the previous one cost nearly $4 million adjusted for today's currency. As far as challenges I had with the project, 
        I had a hard time using Fusion. I am not good at using Fusion. I did become a bit more proficient in the program through the project, though.
